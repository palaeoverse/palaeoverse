# Introduction

<img src="https://github.com/palaeoverse-community/palaeoverse/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

`palaeoverse` is an R package developed by palaeobiologists, for palaeobiologists. The aim of the package is to generate a community-driven toolkit of generic functions for the palaeobiological community. The package does not provide implementations of statistical analyses, rather it provides auxiliary functions to help streamline analyses and improve code readability and reproducibility. This vignette (or tutorial if you prefer) is provided to guide you through the installation process and some of the functionality available within `palaeoverse`. To do so, we will focus on a usage example looking at various trends in tetrapods across the Carboniferous/Permian boundary.

## Installation

The `palaeoverse` package can be installed via CRAN or its dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/palaeoverse-community/palaeoverse) if the development version is preferred. To install via the CRAN, simply use: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
install.packages("palaeoverse")
```

To install the development version, first install the `devtools` package, and then use `install_github` to install `palaeoverse` directly from GitHub. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("palaeoverse-community/palaeoverse")
```

You can now load `palaeoverse` using the default `library` function:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(palaeoverse)
```

The following functions are currently available in `palaeoverse`:

# Now that's out of the way, let's begin!

The Carboniferous and early Permian have been regarded as critical intervals for early four-limbed vertebrates, in terms of both diversification and biogeography. During this time several major groups of tetrapods emerged (including crown amniotes), and the extensive tropical rainforests of the Carboniferous gave way to dryland vegetation during the Permian, in what's known as the 'Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse' (CRC) (for more information, see Dunne et al., 2018). 

In this vignette we’ll use the `tetrapods` dataset to demonstrate how to use `palaeoverse` functions to examine how alpha diversity and range size vary across this interval.

# Dataset

Functions in `palaeoverse` are designed around the assumption that most users' data are stored in an occurrence `data.frame`. As such, this is the expected input data format for most functions. We provide two example occurrence datasets (`tetrapods` and `reefs`) within the package from different data sources. While these two datasets have similar structures, the data (variables) available in each differ. The `tetrapods` dataset is a compilation of Carboniferous--Early Triassic tetrapod occurrences (*n* = 5,270) from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#). We'll be using this dataset to demonstrate some of the available functionality in `palaeoverse`.

Let's get started by exploring the dataset.

```{r echo = TRUE}
# Call the dataset:
data(tetrapods)

# Vew the first five lines:
head(tetrapods)

```

As you can see, we have a variety of variables to play around with! For this vignette we'll mostly be focusing on some of the spatial information, such at latitude and longitude. But first, we need to do some data prep...

# Exploring the functions

If we're looking at patterns of tetrapod diversity and distributioover the Carboniferous and Permian, we'll first have to make sure our occurrences are binned by time and by space. We can do this easily with a few functions in the `palaeoverse` package. Let's first look at binning by time.

There are two `palaeoverse` functions that help us to assign occurrences to different intervals, or 'bins', of time. Firstly, we'll use `time_bins` to make some suitable time bins for our study, which requires a maximum and a minimum time interval to run. As we know we're interested in looking at the Carboniferous and the Permian, we can use these as our intervals to get the suitable stage-level bins that we're after:

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Generate time bins
bins <- time_bins(interval = c("Carboniferous", "Permian"), 
          rank = "stage", 
          scale = "GTS2020", 
          plot = FALSE)

head(bins)

```
Now we're ready to bin the occurrences into these time bins using `bin_time`. For now, we'll go with the 'mid' method, but we'll talk about this more in a minute.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Generate time bins
tetrapods <- bin_time(occdf = tetrapods, 
                 bins = bins, 
                 method = 'mid')

```

Oh no! We've hit an error. This is because there's some occurrences that sit outside of the time intervals we're interested in. `bin_time` can't bin occurrences which sit outside of the time intervals you've chosen, so For it to work, we'll first have to remove these occurrences. 

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Remove occurrences that are younger than the time intervals we're interested in
cp_tetrapods <- tetrapods %>%
  filter(min_ma > min(bins$min_ma))

# Bin occurrences into chosen time bins
mid_tetrapods <- bin_time(occdf = cp_tetrapods, 
                 bins = bins, 
                 method = 'mid')

```

That's better! Let's see how our dataset has changed.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Examine the dataset
str(cp_tetrapods)

```

As you can see, four new columns (variables) have been added to our dataset. Two of these are especially important. First is the `bin_assignment`, which shows which number bin the occurrence has been added to. Second is `n_bins` - this shows how many bins the occurrence could potentially have been placed within. Let's examine this further.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Make a table of potential number of bins
table(cp_tetrapods$n_bins)

```

As you can see, only ~17% of the dataset can be assigned to just one bin - the other occurrences can't be confidently assigned to an individual time interval. This is where the other methods for the `bin_time` function come in handy. They allow the user different options when assigning occurrences to bins. Instead of the 'mid' method, let's try the 'majority' method instead, which places the occurrences in the bin which covers the majority of their potential time range.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Bin occurrences into chosen time bins
maj_tetrapods <- bin_time(occdf = cp_tetrapods, 
                 bins = bins, 
                 method = 'majority')

```

We'd recommend playing around with these different options and seeing how they impact your results!

Next, we'll also bin up occurrences spatially. We need a couple of functions to do this. Firstly, we need to add palaeoco-ordinates to our dataset. We can use the `palaeorotate` function to do this. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Palaeorotate occurrences 
maj_tetrapods <- palaeorotate(occdf = maj_tetrapods, age = "bin_midpoint",
                      method = "point", model = "PALEOMAP")
```

Now let's check that it's worked...

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Check palaeocoordinates
head(maj_tetrapods[, c("p_lng", "p_lat")])
```

Looks good to me! Now that we have palaeoco-ordinates for our occurrences, we can put them into spatial bins. We can do this using the `bin_space` function, which provides a unique equal area grid cell reference for each occurrence. We've chosen a spacing of 100 here to match up with some analyses we're doing later.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Make a table of potential number of bins
maj_tetrapods <- bin_space(occdf = maj_tetrapods, 
          lng = 'p_lng', 
          lat = 'p_lat', 
          spacing = 100
          )

# Show the first 6 rows of the new columns added using `bin_space`.
head(maj_tetrapods[,41:43])

```
`bin_space` also adds some new columns, including one with the unique grid cell ID, as well as latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for the centroid of that cell.

Now that we've both both temporal and spatial information, we can see use these data to see how the spatial coverage of tetrapod fossils in our dataset varies through time. 

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Extract unique interval midpoints
midpoints <- sort(unique(maj_tetrapods$bin_midpoint))

# Calculate the number of unique cells in each time bin
spat.cov <- maj_tetrapods %>%
  select(bin_assignment, cell_ID) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(bin_assignment) %>%
  summarise(n_cells = n())

```
Let's save that for now and move on to some of our analysis!

# 1. Unique taxa and alpha diversity

In many cases palaeobiologists count unique taxa by retaining only unique occurrences identified to a given taxonomic resolution (e.g. genera or species), however this can result in some useful information being discarded. The `tax_unique` function retains occurrences identified to a coarser taxonomic resolution which are not already represented within the dataset. Take, for example, the following occurrences:

- *Albertosaurus sarcophagus*
- *Ankylosaurus* sp.
- *Ceratopsidae* indet.
- *Ornithominus* sp.
- *Tyrannosaurus rex* 

A filter for species-level identifications would reduce the species richness to just two (*A. sarcophagus* and *T. rex*). However, none of these clades are nested within one another, so each of the indeterminately identified occurrences represents at least one species not already represented in the dataset. `tax_unique` is designed to deal with such taxonomic data and would retain all seven 'species' in this example. For further details see `?tax_unique`.

This function can be especially useful for when looking at alpha diversity (local richness). Let's apply it to our dataset by filtering it to genus-level. 

```{r}
# filter to genus-level:
tet_genera <- tax_unique(occdf = maj_tetrapods, genus = "genus", family = "family",
                         order = "order", class = "class", resolution = "genus")
```

We can compare this to the genera from the original dataset to see how many genera were added by using `tax_unique()`:

```{r}
# How many unique genera before:
length(unique(maj_tetrapods$genus))

# How many unique genera after:
length(unique(tet_genera$unique_name))

```

As you can see we've added four occurrences that otherwise would have been ignored! To see more specifically how the function has performed, take a look at row 806, which records an indeterminate occurrence of the family *Melosauridae* This occurrence now has a unique name of 'Melosauridae indet.'

```{r}
tet_genera[806, ]

```

Now, let's use this function to record the number of unique occurrences by collection (=locality) with `group_apply`: 

```{r}
coll_genera <- group_apply(occdf = maj_tetrapods,
                           group = c("collection_no"),
                           fun = tax_unique,
                           genus = "genus",
                           family = "family",
                           order = "order",
                           class = "class",
                           resolution = "genus")

# see structure of the new dataframe:
str(coll_genera)
```

Next, let's count the number of unique taxa per collection (=locality):

```{r}
coll_taxa <- aggregate(coll_genera$unique_name, by=list(coll_genera$collection_no), FUN=length)

# rename column names:
colnames(coll_taxa) <- c("collection_no","n_taxa")

# take a look at the new dataframe
head(coll_taxa)
```

To plot an alpha diversity (local richness) plot, we will need the ages of intervals in millions of years. Since the numeric ages may have changed since we downloaded the data from the PBDB, we'll use `look_up` to get the numeric ages for the occurrences within `tetrapods` dataset based on their assigned interval names:

```{r}
# get new numeric ages for named intervals
# the default is to use the Geological Time Scale 2020
occdf <- look_up(maj_tetrapods)

# take the columns pertaining to collections and their ages in millions of years:
coll_info <- occdf[, c("collection_no", "interval_max_ma", "interval_mid_ma", "interval_min_ma")]

# remove duplicated collections based on the collection number (column 1)
coll_info <- coll_info[!duplicated(coll_info[1]),]

# combine this dataframe with the dataframe from above
alpha_data <- merge(coll_info, coll_taxa, by = "collection_no")

# take a look:
head(alpha_data)

```


Time to plot alpha diversity! Let's start with a simple scatterplot:

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=7.2}

plot(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, alpha_data$n_taxa, # add the points
     xlim = rev(range(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, na.rm = TRUE)), # reverse the x-axis
     xlab="Time (Ma)", ylab="No. taxa", # axes labels
     pch = 19, col = "#0e826f") # point style and colour

```


Whilst that looks good, it's a bit difficult to figure out what stages contain which data points. `axis_geo()` adds a geological timescale between the plot and the axis. 

Taking our plot from above, let's use this function to add a timescale to the x-axis:

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=7.2}
# set margins
par(mar = c(7.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1)) # expand at bottom if adding more interval categories

# alpha diversity plot
plot(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, alpha_data$n_taxa, # add the points
     axes = FALSE,
     xlim = rev(range(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, na.rm = TRUE)), # reverse the x-axis
     xlab=" ", ylab="No. taxa", # axes labels
     pch = 19, col = "#0e826f") # point style and colour
box()
axis(2) # add a normal axis to the elft side
axis_geo(side = 1, intervals = list("epochs", "periods"))
title(xlab = "Time (Ma)", line = 4)


```

Amazing! Now we can clearly see that alpha diversity appears to be a lot higher in the Permian than the Carboniferous. But how has the spatial distribution of tetrapods changed across this boundary? Let's use some of the other `palaeoverse` functions to find out!

# Exploring range size/spatial issues through time

One of the factors we can examine is that of range size.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

test <- tetrapods %>%
  filter(is.na(genus) != T)

group_apply(occdf = test, 
            group = "", 
            fun = bin_)

tax_range_time(occdf = test, 
                name = "genus", 
                min_ma = "min_ma", 
               max_ma = "max_ma", 
               plot = T)

test2 <- tax_range_space(occdf = test, 
                name = "genus", 
                lng = "lng", 
                lat = "lat",
                method = "occ",
                spacing = 100)

test3 <- bin_space(
  occdf = test,
  lng = "lng",
  lat = "lat",
  spacing = 100,
  sub_grid = NULL,
  return = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)

```
