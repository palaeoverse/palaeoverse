Let’s start exploring dataset. conducting analyses, always good idea explore data understand working . Details related example datasets can accessed via usual documentation call: Let’s start exploring data little: bad (n = 4363), ’s quite bit data play ! Remember reefs (whole ecosystems), individual occurrences fossil organisms like tetrapods. much vary across time? can make use group_apply wrapper function run function across subsets data. Oh dear, ’ve just hit common issue… reef data conform common time scale! reefs resolved stage level, others resolved coarser finer temporal resolution. instances, regional names also used, international names used others. makes challenging make comparisons time… one solution use age values bin reefs time bins, age range data provided dataset (.e. “max_ma” “min_ma”). must therefore use names interval link common time scale, ‘International Geological Stages’ established International Commission Stratigraphy (ICS). Fortunately, can make use look_up function . function can used assign international geological stages numeric ages occurrences, use user-defined interval key link common time scale. , use example interval_key available palaeoverse assign international geological stage names numeric ages. Great! now common time scale numeric ages. However, reefs seem range several stages can’t count just early late stage. data still need binned. Let’s check time_bins bin_time functions.

However, sake brevity, let’s focus research theme: latitudinal trends Phanerozoic reefs. studying modern latitudinal trends (e.g. biodiversity), researchers can use geographic coordinates samples conduct analyses. However, continents shift time, palaeobiologists must reconstruct palaeogeographic coordinates fossil localities. , plate rotation models used (e.g. PALEOMAP model) rotate modern coordinates fossil localities location time deposition. palaeorotate function allows user using either ‘point’ ‘grid’ method. first approach makes use GPlates Web Service allows point data rotated specific ages using available models (see GPlates Web Service documentation). second approach uses reconstruction files pre-generated palaeocoordinates spatiotemporally link occurrences’ modern coordinates age estimates respective palaeocoordinates. Let’s give shot: Now let’s plot palaeolatitudinal distribution! plot chunk reefs-dist Neat! ’s hard draw trends data (lot !). can better… let’s summarise information… assume reefs broadly limited tropical subtropical climatic conditions, poleward reef time bin give us estimate palaeolatitudinal extent climatic conditions. plot chunk reefs-max ’s definitely much clearer! stop ? Well… one last thing… let’s consider plate rotation model choice might impact results using three different models: GOLONKA, PALEOMAP, MERDITH2021 (Wright et al. 2013; Scotese & Wright, 2018; Merdith et al. 2021).
