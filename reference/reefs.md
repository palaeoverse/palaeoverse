# Example dataset: Phanerozoic reefs from the PaleoReefs Database

A dataset of Phanerozoic reef occurrences from the [PaleoReefs
Database](https://www.paleo-reefs.pal.uni-erlangen.de) (PARED). This
example dataset includes a subset of the available data from PARED, but
can be used to demonstrate how the functions in the `palaeoverse`
package might be applied.
