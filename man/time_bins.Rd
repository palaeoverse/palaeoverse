\usage{
time_bins(
  interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"),
  rank = "stage",
  size = NULL,
  assign = NULL,
  scale = "GTS2020",
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interval}{\code{character or numeric}. Interval name available
in \code{\link{GTS2020}} or \code{\link{GTS2012}}.
If a single interval name is provided, this interval is returned.
If two interval names are provided, these intervals and those existing
between are returned. If a single numeric age is provided, the interval that
covers this age is returned.
If two numeric ages are provided, the intervals occurring in the range of
these ages are returned.}

\item{rank}{\code{character}. Which stratigraphic rank is desired? Choose
from: "stage", "epoch", "period", "era", and "eon".}

\item{size}{\code{numeric}. If equal-length time bins are desired, specify
the length in millions of years (Myr) of the time bins desired.}

\item{assign}{\code{numeric}. A numeric vector of age estimates to use to
assign to requested bins. If assign is specified, a numeric vector is
returned of the midpoint age of the specified bins. Note this is the
simplified approach of assignment in \code{palaeoverse} included for data with
'known' point-age estimates.
For a wider range of binning methods, see
\code{\link[palaeoverse:bin_time]{palaeoverse::bin_time()}}.}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to
be used "GTS2020" or "GTS2012". "GTS2020" is the default.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of time bins be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of time bins for the specified intervals or a
list with a \code{dataframe} of time bins and a named \code{numeric}
vector (bin number) of binned age estimates (midpoint of specified bins) if
assign is specified.
}
\description{
A function to generate time bins for a given study interval. This function
is flexible in that either stage-level or higher stratigraphic-level
(e.g. period) time bins can be called.
In addition, near equal-length time bins can be generated by grouping stages
together. For example, for 10 Myr as a target bin size, the
function will generate groups of bins that have a mean bin length close to
10 Myr.
However, users may also want to consider grouping stages based on other
reasoning e.g. availability of outcrop (see Dean et al. (2020);
\doi{https://doi.org/10.1111/pala.12492}).
}
\details{
This function uses the Geological Timescale 2020 and the Geological
Timescale 2012 (depending on user specification).
Additional information on each timescale and source can be accessed via:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{GTS2020}}
\item \code{\link{GTS2012}}
}

Available intervals names are accessible via the \code{interval_name}
column in \code{GTS2012} and \code{GTS2020}. Data of the Geological Timescale 2020
and 2012 were compiled by Lewis A. Jones (2022-07-02).

#Using numeric age

#Using numeric age range
ex2 <- time_bins(interval = c(50, 100), plot = TRUE)

#Using a single interval name
ex3 <- time_bins(interval = c("Maastrichtian"), plot = TRUE)

#Using a range of intervals and near-equal duration bins
ex4 <- time_bins(interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"),
                 size = 10, plot = TRUE)

#Assign bins based on given age estimates
ex5 <- time_bins(interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"),
                 assign = c(232, 167, 33))
