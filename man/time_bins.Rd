\usage{
time_bins(
  interval = "Phanerozoic",
  rank = "stage",
  size = NULL,
  assign = NULL,
  scale = "GTS2020",
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interval}{\code{character or numeric}. Interval name available in
\code{\link{GTS2020}} or \code{\link{GTS2012}}. If a single interval name
is provided, this interval is returned. If two interval names are
provided, these intervals and those existing between are returned. If a
single numeric age is provided, the interval that covers this age is
returned. If two numeric ages are provided, the intervals occurring in
the range of these ages are returned. Defaults to "Phanerozoic". This
argument is ignored if \code{scale} is not "GTS2020" or "GTS2012".}

\item{rank}{\code{character}. Which stratigraphic rank is desired? Choose
from: "stage", "epoch", "period", "era", and "eon". This argument is
ignored if \code{scale} is not "GTS2020" or "GTS2012".}

\item{size}{\code{numeric}. If equal-length time bins are desired, specify
the length in millions of years (Myr) of the time bins desired.}

\item{assign}{\code{numeric}. A numeric vector of age estimates to use to
assign to requested bins. If assign is specified, a numeric vector is
returned of the midpoint age of the specified bins. Note this is the
simplified approach of assignment in \code{palaeoverse} included for data with
'known' point-age estimates. For a wider range of binning methods, see
\code{\link[palaeoverse:bin_time]{palaeoverse::bin_time()}}.}

\item{scale}{\code{character} or \code{data.frame}. Specify the desired
geological timescale to be used "GTS2020" (default), "GTS2012", a valid
timescale from
\href{https://macrostrat.org/api/defs/timescales?all}{Macrostrat}, or
user-input \code{data.frame}. If a \code{data.frame} is provided, it must contain
at least the following named columns: "interval_name", "max_ma", and
"min_ma". As such, age data should be provided in Ma.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of time bins be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of time bins for the specified intervals or a
list with a \code{dataframe} of time bins and a named \code{numeric}
vector (bin number) of binned age estimates (midpoint of specified bins)
if assign is specified.
}
\description{
A function to generate time bins for a given study interval and geological
timescale. This function is flexible in that either stage-level or higher
stratigraphic-level (e.g. period) time bins can be called, valid timescales
from \href{https://macrostrat.org/api/defs/timescales?all}{Macrostrat} can be
used, or a \code{data.frame} of a geological time scale can be provided. In
addition, near equal-length time bins can be generated by grouping
intervals together. For example, for a target bin size of 10 Myr, the
function will generate groups of bins that have a mean bin length close to
10 Myr. However, users may also want to consider grouping stages based on
other reasoning e.g. availability of outcrop (see Dean et al. 2020).
}
\details{
This function uses either the Geological Time Scale 2020,
Geological Time Scale 2012, a valid timescale from
\href{https://macrostrat.org/api/defs/timescales?all}{Macrostrat}, or a
user-input \code{data.frame} (see \code{scale} argument) to generate time bins.
Additional information on included Geological Time Scales and source can
be accessed via:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{GTS2020}}
\item \code{\link{GTS2012}}
}

Available intervals names are accessible via the \code{interval_name} column
in \code{GTS2012} and \code{GTS2020}. Data of the Geological Timescale 2020 and
2012 were compiled by Lewis A. Jones (2022-07-02).
