\usage{
tax_time_expand(
  taxdf,
  max_ma = "max_ma",
  min_ma = "min_ma",
  scale = "GTS2020",
  rank = "stage",
  ext_orig = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxdf}{\code{dataframe}. A \code{data.frame} of taxa (such as that
produced by \code{\link{tax_range_time}}) with columns for the maximum and
minimum ages (FADs and LADs). Each row should represent a unique taxon.
Additional columns may be included (e.g., taxon names, additional taxonomy,
etc) and will be included in the returned \code{data.frame}. If required,
\code{numeric} ages can be generated from interval names via the
\code{\link{look_up}} function.}

\item{max_ma}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the maximum limit (FADs) of the age range (e.g., "max_ma").}

\item{min_ma}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the minimum limit (LADs) of the age range (e.g., "min_ma").}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to
be used, either "GTS2020" or "GTS2012".}

\item{rank}{\code{character}. Specify the desired stratigraphic rank. Choose
from: "stage", "epoch", "period", "era", and "eon".}

\item{ext_orig}{\code{logical}. Should two additional columns be added to
identify the intervals in which taxa originated and went extinct?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} where each row represents an interval during which
a taxon in the original user-supplied data persisted. The columns are
identical to those in the user-supplied data with additional columns
included to identify the intervals. If \code{ext_orig} is \code{TRUE},
two additional columns are added to identify in which intervals taxa
originated and went extinct.
}
\description{
A function to generate interval-level pseudo-occurrences for taxa based on
temporal ranges (e.g., the output of \code{\link{tax_range_time}}). While the
resulting pseudo-occurrences should not be treated as equivalent to actual
occurrence data (e.g., like that from the Paleobiology Database), such
pseudo-occurrences may be useful for performing statistical analyses where
the row representing a taxon must be replicated for each interval through
which the taxon persisted.
