\title{Summarise abundance of fossil occurrences}
\usage{
tax_rel_abun(occdf, rank = "genus", plot = FALSE, plot_args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences.}

\item{rank}{\code{character}. The taxonomic rank at which you want to calculate abundance.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a rank abundance distribution plot be generated?}

\item{plot_args}{\code{list}. A list of optional arguments relevant to
plotting. See Details for options.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} containing the following columns: Taxon ID (\code{Taxon}),
absolute abundance of each fossil taxon (\code{Abundance}),
Relative abundance of each fossil taxon (\code{Rel_abundance}),
natural logarithm of relative abundance of each fossil taxon (\code{Log_rel_abundance}),
abundance rank within dataset (\code{Abundance_rank}).

@details The (absolute and relative) abundance of each taxon is calculated by tabulating all occurrences of
unique taxa (\code{Taxon} column) from the input \code{occdf}. Absolute abundance is calculated by counting the number of occurrences,
while relative abundance is calculated relative to the community in the dataset (or subset).
A plot of the rank abundance distribution is also returned if \code{plot = TRUE}.
Customisable argument options
(i.e. \code{\link[graphics:par]{graphics::par()}}) to pass to \code{plot_args} as a list (and their
defaults) for plotting include:
\itemize{
\item xlab = "Abundance rank"
\item ylab = "Relative abundance"
\item col = "black"
\item bg = "black"
\item pch = 20
\item cex = 1
}
