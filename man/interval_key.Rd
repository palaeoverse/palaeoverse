\title{Example dataset: Interval key for the look_up function}
\format{
A data frame with 1323 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{interval_name}{Stratigraphic interval}
\item{early_stage}{Earliest (oldest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
\item{late_stage}{Latest (youngest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
}

Compiled by Kilian Eichenseer and Lewis Jones for assigning
geological stages to ccurrences from the

and the \href{https://www.paleo-reefs.pal.uni-erlangen.de/}{PaleoReefs Database}.

\description{
A table of geological intervals and the earliest and latest
corresponding international geological stages from the International
Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). The table was compiled using
regional stratigraphies, the \href{https://timescalefoundation.org/resources/geowhen/}{GeoWhen Database}, temporal
information from the \href{https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displaySearchStrataForm}{Paleobiology Database} and the
\href{https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2022-10.pdf}{Geological Timescale 2020}.
Some assignments were made with incomplete information on
the stratigraphic provenance of intervals. The assignments in this
table should be verified before research use. They are provided here
as an example of functionality only.
