\title{Generate pseudo-occurrences from latitudinal range data}
\usage{
tax_expand_lat(taxdf, bins, max_lat = "max_lat", min_lat = "min_lat")
}
\arguments{
\item{taxdf}{\code{dataframe}. A \code{data.frame} of taxa (such as the
output of the 'lat' method in \code{\link{tax_range_geo}}) with columns
containing latitudinal range data (maximum and minimum latitude). Column
names are assumed to be "max_lat" and "min_lat", but may be updated via the
\code{max_lat} and \code{min_lat} arguments.
Each row should represent a unique taxon. Additional columns may be included
(e.g. taxon names, additional taxonomy, etc) and will be included in the
returned \code{data.frame}.}

\item{bins}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the bins that you wish to
allocate fossil occurrences to, such as that returned by
\code{\link{lat_bins}}. This dataframe must contain at least the following
named columns: "bin", "max" and "min".}

\item{max_lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be
treated as the maximum latitude of the latitudinal range (e.g. "max_lat").}

\item{min_lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be
treated as the minimum latitude of the latitudinal range (e.g. "min_lat").}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} where each row represents a latitudinal bin which
a taxon ranges through. The columns are identical to those in the
user-supplied data with additional columns included to identify bins. Output
will be returned in the order of supplied bins.
}
\description{
A function to generate pseudo-occurrences for taxa based on latitudinal
ranges (e.g. the output of the 'lat' method in \code{\link{tax_range_geo}}).
While the resulting pseudo-occurrences should not be treated as equivalent
to actual occurrence data (e.g. like that from the Paleobiology Database),
such pseudo-occurrences may be useful for  performing statistical analyses
where the row representing a taxon must be replicated for each latitudinal
bin through which the taxon ranges.
